            <h3 className="text-navy font-gilroy-bold text-xl mt-8 mb-4">1. Contractual Agreement</h3>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              The contract is between you and us. We both agree that English law (and no other) will apply to your contract and to any dispute, claim, or other matter of any description that arises between us (except as set out below). We both also agree that any dispute, claim, or other matter of any description (and whether or not involving any personal injury) that arises between us must be dealt with by the Courts of Kolkata only. None of our employees have the authority to vary or omit any of these terms. No promise of a discount or refund will be binding on us unless confirmed by us in writing.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-navy font-gilroy-bold text-xl mt-8 mb-4">2. Securing Your Booking</h3>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              To secure a booking, you must pay us (or our authorized booking agent) the full payment of the booking as is advised to you at the time of booking.
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              When you submit your booking request, we will treat this as a 'not-guaranteed' booking. At this point, the booking is only provisional and is not confirmed. Your booking is accepted and becomes definite only from the date when we send you an email to confirm that your 'on request' booking has been confirmed. It is at this point that a contract between you and us comes into existence.
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              For bookings made via our website, any acknowledgment of your booking request we send to you in the meantime is not a confirmation of your booking.
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              Before your booking is confirmed and a contract comes into force, we reserve the right to increase or decrease prices.
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              We (and our agents) reserve the right to decline any booking at our absolute discretion.
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              If you book via our website, we will communicate with you by email. You must accordingly check your emails on a regular basis. We may also contact you by phone call or social media platforms if we cannot, for whatever reason, contact you by email. Certain documents may need to be sent by post. References in these conditions to "send" and "in writing" or similar include communication by email. You should contact us by email if you need to do so for any of the reasons mentioned in these booking conditions (for example, to request an amendment). All emails should be sent to support@fraterny.com
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              A booking is secured with full payment, payable within 5 days of booking confirmation. Payment can be made through various methods including, but not limited to, credit cards and direct bank transfers.
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular font-semibold">PAYMENT FOR YOUR PROGRAM</p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              The balance of all monies due, including any surcharges applicable at that time, must be received by us (or our authorized agent) no later than 20 days before the start of your program.
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              If we do not receive this balance in full and on time, we reserve the right to treat your booking as canceled by you, in which case the cancellation charges set out in clause 4 below will become payable.
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              You can pay the deposit and full amount by UPI, bank transfer credit or debit card. Other payment methods may be available on our integrated third-party payment portal.
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              There is only 1 case in which you are exempted from making your full payment 20 days before your program's start date, these exemptions include:
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              Exemption: In a situation where we have explicitly agreed on partial payment in cash on email and you have confirmed your Program, you can make a partial payment of 50% towards your program within 5 days of booking confirmation. You must settle the remaining 50% balance as soon as you have arrived at the venue. In case of Cancellation after Partial Payment has been made, Fraterny will deduct 30% of your payment in cancellation charges while the remaining 20% will be credited towards a future program and you will get priority booking as per your discretion and program availability.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-navy font-gilroy-bold text-xl mt-8 mb-4">3. Pricing and Surcharges</h3>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              The most up-to-date pricing for our Program is available on our website. Prices are subject to change due to variations in taxes. Our advertised Program prices are also subject to seasonal adjustments and may vary based on demand and market conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon booking and paying the required amount, the price quoted at that time is locked in, irrespective of subsequent price increases or decreases. Price increases following a deposit will not affect your booking unless they exceed 8% of the total Program cost, in which case you will be entitled to cancel with a full refund or accept an alternative Program of equivalent quality without additional charges. Should the price decrease after your booking, these reductions will not apply retrospectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              Promotional offers, including discounts and early booking incentives, are applicable at the time of booking and cannot be transferred to future bookings or applied retrospectively. If you transfer your booking to a different Program that also offers an early booking discount, and availability allows, the discount will apply; otherwise, it will not carry over.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any price adjustments downward due to the aforementioned factors that occur after your booking will result in a refund to you, less an administrative fee, except in the last 30 days before departure, during which period no refunds for price adjustments will be made.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-navy font-gilroy-bold text-xl mt-8 mb-4">4. Changes and Cancellations by You</h3>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular font-semibold">IF YOU CHANGE OR TRANSFER YOUR BOOKING</p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              If you wish to modify any aspect of your booking after receiving our email confirmation, please notify us in writing as soon as possible. The request should be submitted by the lead attendee on the booking. While we will make every effort to accommodate your request, we cannot guarantee its feasibility.
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              If a change or transfer can be facilitated, an administration fee of ₹7,000 per booking, along with any additional costs or charges incurred by us, will be applicable. Subsequently, any changes will be treated as cancellations and will be subject to the charges outlined below. All changes are subject to availability.
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              For a fee of ₹7,000 per booking, you may opt to receive a credit voucher equivalent to the amount paid for any canceled booking. This voucher must be redeemed within 3 months of issuance for a new booking. Please note that the voucher is non-transferable, can only be redeemed once, and cannot be exchanged for cash. No refund or additional credit voucher will be provided if the cost of the new booking is lower than the value of the credit voucher.
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              You are allowed a maximum of three transfers, with each transfer incurring a transfer fee. The fees from previous transfers will accumulate with each new transfer. Following three transferred bookings, all accumulated fees from previous transfers must be settled to be eligible for any further transfer requests. In the event of a cancellation after any transfer, the initial deposit and subsequent payments will not be transferred to credit but will be subject to our standard cancellation policy. By confirming a booking, you acknowledge and agree to adhere to these transfer terms.
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              If we are unable to accommodate your request for modification and you choose not to proceed with the original booking, we will consider it as a cancellation by you. In such cases, a cancellation fee may apply as per Clause 4.
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular font-semibold">IF YOU CANCEL YOUR BOOKING BEFORE DEPARTURE</p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              If you or any other member of your group decides to cancel your confirmed booking, you must notify us in writing. Your cancellation will only take effect upon receipt of written notification by us at our office and will be effective from the date of receipt.
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              Since costs are incurred in canceling your arrangements, cancellation charges will apply as follows. The charges are calculated as a percentage of the total price per person canceling, excluding any amendment charges and insurance premiums. Please note that some suppliers may impose higher or different charges, which will be communicated to you at the time of booking if applicable.
            </p>
            <ul className="mb-4 font-gilroy-regular">
              <li>From booking until 60 days before the Program start date – Full amount retained by Fraterny</li>
              <li>30-60 days before Program start date – 50% of Program cost</li>
              <li>20-30 days before Program start date – 75% of Program cost</li>
              <li>20-0 days before Program start date – 100% of Program cost</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              These charges do not apply to bookings transferred to a future departure date, where the original Program start date (before transfer) will be used to calculate any applicable charges.
            </p>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              Amendment charges and insurance premiums are non-refundable in the event of cancellation.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-navy font-gilroy-bold text-xl mt-8 mb-4">5. Changes and Cancellations by Us</h3>
            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              We plan Programs well in advance, but occasionally we must make changes or cancel confirmed bookings.

            <p className="font-gilroy-regular">
              We emphasize the importance of making a booking at the earliest opportunity because of the small group nature of our Programs.
